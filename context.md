# Context: Real-Life RPG Gamified Self-Improvement App

## Purpose

The application is designed as a **real-life RPG** to aid users in enhancing various aspects of their personal lives through structured self-improvement. Inspired by the **Octalysis framework** for gamification, the app allows users to set goals, track progress, and be rewarded in a way that emulates role-playing game (RPG) mechanics. Users can create **self-improvement areas** (e.g., Health, Finance, Social) and define specific **projects** and **tasks** within each area. Completing tasks grants experience points (XP), leveling up the user’s skills in each area over time, with the added incentives of **health points (HP)**, **coins**, and streak rewards.

Ultimately, the app functions as a sandbox for self-development, turning mundane tasks and goals into an engaging and interactive experience.

## Core Features

### 1. **Self-Improvement Areas & Projects**
   - Users create **areas** that represent key domains they wish to improve, such as **Health**, **Finance**, or **Productivity**.
   - Each area can contain **projects**, which are specific goals or focus points within the area. For instance, under Health, a user might create a project called "Nutrition."
   - Completing tasks under a project grants XP that contributes to the area’s overall level, allowing users to see progress in each area.

### 2. **Task Management System**
   - **Task Types**:
     - **Single Task**: Basic tasks that can be tracked by a binary (yes/no) goal or a numerical target (e.g., "Drink 2 liters of water").
     - **Placeholder Task**: Tasks that contain **sub-tasks** and can alternate between specific actions. For example, a "Gym" placeholder task could have sub-tasks like "Back Day" and "Chest Day," which rotate according to a user-defined sequence.
     - **Sub-Task**: Subordinate tasks that inherit the scheduling of their parent placeholder task.
   - **Recurring Tasks**: Users can set tasks to recur on a daily, weekly, or custom schedule.
   - **Task Instances**: Each recurring task automatically generates instances, allowing users to check off completion and track consistency.
   - **Progress Tracking**: Tasks can be linked to either a project or directly to an area, with completion data feeding into analytics and insights.

### 3. **Experience Points (XP) & Leveling System**
   - Completing tasks and instances provides XP in the associated area.
   - XP contributes to leveling up within each area, reflecting personal growth and progress.
   - User levels and XP needed for the next level are displayed on the dashboard, providing an ongoing incentive to complete tasks.

### 4. **Health Points (HP) & Habit Tracking**
   - Users start with a set number of **health points (HP)**.
   - Missing scheduled tasks or engaging in tracked bad habits (e.g., excessive screen time) results in HP loss.
   - Regular task completion and positive streaks restore HP, helping users avoid penalties and stay engaged.

### 5. **Coin Rewards & Spending System**
   - Users earn **coins** for completing tasks, with rewards calibrated based on the task’s difficulty and frequency.
   - Coins serve as both a motivational tool and a virtual budget, representing permissions to spend on real-life purchases.
   - **Catch-up Vouchers**: Coins can also be used to purchase catch-up vouchers, allowing users to offset missed tasks.

### 6. **Routine & Calendar Integration**
   - Users can create **routines** (e.g., Morning Routine) that group tasks under one schedule. Routines display tasks in an organized order.
   - **Calendar Interface**: A calendar view provides a comprehensive look at daily tasks, routines, and reminders.
   - **Reminders and Notifications**: Users receive reminders for upcoming tasks and routines, supporting habit formation.

### 7. **Data Insights & Dashboards**
   - **Completion Insights**: Users can view completion rates, streaks, and progress insights for individual tasks, projects, and areas.
   - **Streak and Habit Data**: Visualizations of successful streaks or missed tasks help users identify strengths and areas for improvement.
   - **XP & Progress Tracking**: Each area shows levels, XP progress, and the XP required for the next level.

### 8. **Social & Competitive Elements**
   - **Friends System**: Users can add friends to view each other’s progress and engage in joint tasks or challenges.
   - **Leaderboards and Challenges**: A leaderboard ranks top users based on XP or tasks completed, while regular challenges encourage healthy competition.

### 9. **Advanced Gamification Features**
   - **Negative Balance & Damage**: Users in a negative balance of coins or XP lose HP each day until they balance their points.
   - **Nutrition and Health Tracking**: Additional counters track nutrition (e.g., weekly fish intake) and water consumption.
   - **Future Features**:
     - **Training Programs**: Users can create custom programs, tracking physical and mental exercise regimens.
     - **Coins for Real-Life Budgeting**: Coins represent a virtual budget and spending constraint, helping users align real-life purchases with their self-improvement goals.

## Future Vision

This app is designed to be expandable, with a roadmap for incorporating new features as user engagement grows. Upcoming developments include deeper habit tracking, health monitoring, enhanced social features, and competitive events. With a flexible foundation, the app is positioned for long-term evolution, adapting to meet the personal development needs of its users.
