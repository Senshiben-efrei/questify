# Context: Real-Life RPG Gamified Self-Improvement App

## Purpose

The application is designed as a **real-life RPG** to aid users in enhancing various aspects of their personal lives through structured self-improvement. The app allows users to set goals, track progress, and be rewarded in a way that emulates role-playing game (RPG) mechanics. Users can create **self-improvement areas** (e.g., Health, Finance, Social) and define specific **projects** and **tasks** within each area.

## Core Features

### 1. **Areas & Projects Structure**
   - Users create **areas** that represent key domains they wish to improve (e.g., Health, Finance, Productivity)
   - Each area can contain **projects**, which are specific goals or focus points within that area (e.g., "Get fit", "Save money", "Learn a new skill")

### 2. **Routine System**
   - **Routines**: Collections of tasks that can be scheduled and repeated
   - **Queue Management**: Tasks within routines are organized in iterations that can be rotated sequentially
   - **Task Types**:
     - Regular tasks with yes/no completion
     - Numeric tasks with progress tracking
     - Cooldown periods between task iterations
   - **Task Properties**:
     - Difficulty levels (Trivial, Easy, Medium, Hard)
     - Specific time scheduling
     - Duration tracking
     - Area and Project association

### 3. **Task Management**
   - **Task Instances**: Each routine generates instances based on its schedule
   - **Progress Tracking**: Tasks can be marked as completed or track numeric progress
   - **Status System**: Tasks can be pending, completed, or overdue
   - **Time Management**: Tasks can have specific execution times and durations

### 4. **Dashboard & Overview**
   - **Areas Overview**: Radar chart showing progress across different life areas
   - **Task Organization**:
     - Overdue tasks grouped by date
     - Today's pending tasks
     - Completed tasks tracking
   - **Progress Visualization**: Visual indicators for task status and completion

### 5. **Calendar Integration**
   - Calendar view for task scheduling and overview
   - Daily, weekly, and monthly task planning
   - Visual representation of task distribution

### 6. **Setup & Configuration**
   - Area creation and management
   - Project organization within areas
   - Routine creation with flexible queue system
   - Task configuration with multiple parameters

## Future Vision

The app is designed with extensibility in mind, focusing on providing a solid foundation for task and routine management while maintaining the flexibility to add more gamification features in the future. The current implementation emphasizes practical functionality while keeping the door open for enhanced gaming elements as the system evolves.
