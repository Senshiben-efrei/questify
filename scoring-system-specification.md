# Scoring System Implementation Specification

## 1. Prerequisite Data Structures and Considerations

### 1.1 Task Instance Metadata
For scoring purposes, each task instance must include the following additional metadata:
- Unique Identifier
- Associated Area (optional)
- Project Association (optional)
- Difficulty Level
- Task Type (numeric/boolean)
- Scheduled Date
- Actual Completion Date
- Completion Status
- Completion Quality (optional user-rated)

### 1.2 Task Difficulty Levels
Standardized difficulty levels:
- Trivial
- Easy
- Medium
- Hard
- Epic (optional extreme difficulty)

### 1.3 Task Type Classification
- Boolean Completion Tasks
- Numeric Progress Tasks
- Repeatable Tasks
- One-time Tasks
- Routine-based Tasks

## 2. User Performance Rating (UPR) Core Components

### 2.1 Area Mastery Score (AMS)
#### Calculation Principles
- Computed per area where tasks exist
- Score range: 0-100
- Composed of multiple sub-metrics

##### Sub-metrics for Area Score
1. Streak Tracking (40% weight)
   - Consecutive engagement days
   - Logarithmic scaling
   - Rewards consistent effort
   - Max points at 90-day continuous engagement

2. Completion Rate (30% weight)
   - Percentage of planned tasks completed
   - Weighted by task difficulty
   - Considers task complexity

3. Diversity of Engagement (20% weight)
   - Variety of completed tasks
   - Unique task types
   - Different project sub-goals
   - Prevents repetitive approaches

4. Quality of Execution (10% weight)
   - Optional user-rated task quality
   - Prevents low-effort completions

### 2.2 Task Complexity Matrix (TCM)
#### Scoring Mechanism
- Assign point values based on task difficulty
- Prevent gaming through repetitive easy tasks
- Encourage challenging personal growth

##### Difficulty Point Values
- Trivial Task: 1 point
- Easy Task: 2 points
- Medium Task: 3 points
- Hard Task: 5 points
- Epic Task: 8 points

### 2.3 Consistency Coefficient (CC)
#### Multi-layered Consistency Tracking
1. Daily Engagement Patterns
2. Weekly Participation
3. Monthly Commitment
4. Long-term Streaks

##### Tracking Mechanisms
- Maintain rolling window of engagement
- Implement decay for periods of inactivity
- Provide grace periods for life interruptions

### 2.4 Diversity Multiplier (DM)
#### Evaluation Criteria
- Number of unique task types completed
- Cross-area task diversity
- Exploration of different challenge categories

## 3. User Performance Rating (UPR) Calculation

### 3.1 Base UPR Formula
```
UPR = (
  (AMS * 0.4) + 
  (TCM * 0.25) + 
  (CC * 0.2) + 
  (DM * 0.15)
) * Global Consistency Modifier
```

### 3.2 Global Consistency Modifier
- Rewards sustained long-term engagement
- Exponential growth with consistent performance

#### Modifier Tiers
- 0-3 months: 1.0x
- 3-6 months: 1.2x
- 6-12 months: 1.5x
- 1-2 years: 2.0x
- 2+ years: 2.5x

## 4. Anti-Gaming Mechanisms

### 4.1 Task Repetition Limitations
- Implement diminishing returns for repeated tasks
- Require task variety within areas
- Cooldown periods for identical actions

### 4.2 Quality Validation
- Optional user-rated task completion
- System-detected low-effort completions
- Potential temporary score reductions

## 5. Competitive Features

### 5.1 Leaderboard Stratification
- Global UPR Ranking
- Peer Group Rankings
  - Age segments
  - Initial skill levels
  - Specific goal categories

### 5.2 Achievement Tiers
- Bronze: 0-1000 UPR
- Silver: 1001-2500 UPR
- Gold: 2501-5000 UPR
- Platinum: 5001-10000 UPR
- Diamond: 10000+ UPR

## 6. Implementation Considerations

### 6.1 Performance Optimization
- Batch calculation of scores
- Cached computation
- Periodic (not real-time) updates

### 6.2 Privacy and Transparency
- User-controllable visibility
- Clear scoring mechanics explanation
- Optional competitive features

## 7. Future Expansion Points
- Machine learning enhanced scoring
- Personalized difficulty recommendations
- Adaptive challenge generation

## 8. Monitoring and Adjustment
- Regular scoring system review
- User feedback integration
- Periodic recalibration of weights and mechanisms
